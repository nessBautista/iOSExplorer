//: # Make a Class Threadsafe
//: ## The Problem: Race Condition
//: When you're using asynchronous calls then you need to consider thread safety.
//: Consider the following object:
let nameChangingPerson = Person(firstName: "Alison", lastName: "Anderson")
//: The `Person` class includes a method to change names:
nameChangingPerson.changeName(firstName: "Brian", lastName: "Biggles")
nameChangingPerson.name
//: What happens if you try and use the `changeName(firstName:lastName:)` simulataneously from a concurrent queue?
let workerQueue = DispatchQueue(label: "com.raywenderlich.worker", attributes: .concurrent)
let nameChangeGroup = DispatchGroup()

let nameList = [("Charlie", "Cheesecake"), ("Delia", "Dingle"), ("Eva", "Evershed"), ("Freddie", "Frost"), ("Gina", "Gregory")]

// Comment out the code below before you implement ThreadSafePerson
//for (idx, name) in nameList.enumerated() {
//  workerQueue.async(group: nameChangeGroup) {
//    usleep(UInt32(10_000 * idx))
//    nameChangingPerson.changeName(firstName: name.0, lastName: name.1)
//    print("Current Name: \(nameChangingPerson.name)")
//  }
//}
//
//nameChangeGroup.notify(queue: DispatchQueue.global()) {
//  print("Final name: \(nameChangingPerson.name)")
//  PlaygroundPage.current.finishExecution()
//}
//
//nameChangeGroup.wait()
//: __Result:__ `nameChangingPerson` has been left in an inconsistent state.
//:
//: ## The Solution: Dispatch Barrier for Thread Safety
//: A barrier allows you add a task to a concurrent queue that will be run in a serial fashion, i.e., it will wait for the currently queued tasks to complete, and prevent any new ones starting.
class ThreadSafePerson: Person {
    //Create a custom concurrent dispatch queue
    let isolationQueue = DispatchQueue(label: "com.concurrencyLab.isolation", attributes: .concurrent)
    //Override changeName to make it a dispatch barrier task on isolation queue.
    override func changeName(firstName: String, lastName: String) {
        isolationQueue.async(flags: .barrier) {
            //barrier task:
            //Isolation queue must be a custom Concurrent dispatch queue to implement dispatch barrier.
            //You don't want to block a global dispatch queue
            //and you want to run nonbarrier tasks concurrently
            super.changeName(firstName: firstName, lastName: lastName)
        }
    }
    
    //you will also use the isolation queue to control read access to class properties
    override var name: String {
        isolationQueue.sync {
            //it doesn't return until it has a value.
            //because changeName is a barrier task, the va√±ue will always be
            //A valid name
            super.name
        }
    }

//When a changeName task enters isolation queue, it prevents new tasks
//from starting  and waits for current tasks to finish.
//When the current task have finished. changeName runs all on its own,
//with exclusive read/write access to the object. The concurrent queue becomes
//temporarily serial, no other change tasks can sneak in and change firstName or lastName
//while this changeName task is setting the values. So the name it creates matches
//its input arguments exactly
//: Now run the __TSanExample project__, to see Xcode's thread sanitizer find the race condition errors.
